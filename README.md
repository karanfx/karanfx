<h2>About Me</h2>

As I embark on my journey as a Pipeline Technical Director (Pipeline TD), I bring with me a rich background in the vibrant world of visual effects. With three years of hands-on experience as an FX and Crowd FX Artist, I've been fortunate to work on exhilarating projects that have sparked my passion for the intersection of creativity and technology.

 My skills includes Particles, Rigid Body Dynamics, Pyro, FLIP and Vellum Simulations. I am experienced in using industry-standard software such as Houdini, Nuke, and Maya, and am constantly expanding my skillset to stay up to date with the latest technologies and trends including programming Languages like Python, C++, and VEX.

My portfolio may be fresh, but it's rooted in the invaluable experiences I've gained as an FX Artist. It showcases my unique perspective, highlighting my ability to bridge the gap between artistic vision and technical execution. My goal as a Pipeline TD is to nurture and elevate the creative process, and my portfolio reflects this aspiration.


Throughout my career, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams and have been part of some great projects like Vikkings Vahalla, Bhediya, Crator, Big George Foreman and much more upcoming.

I am passionate about what I do and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. If you are looking for a dedicated and skilled FX artist to join your team, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
